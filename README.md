# Analytics-For-FAST-Alumni-Network
This is the repository of my final year project:The project had models of data scraping, pre-processing and analytics. Data scraping model consist of
various scrappers to fetch alumni data from internet sources and campus records (QEC and Placement
office). The pre-step for analytics was data pre-paration.The data pre-paration includes filtering and
cleaning of data. The next step was data syncronization to make a single pattern of that data from sources.
Data mining techniques were applied for the processd data. The data mining results were ploted using
several visualization techniques. A set of machine learning alogorithms were used to find the trends in data.
The entire project was deployed using PowerBI.
